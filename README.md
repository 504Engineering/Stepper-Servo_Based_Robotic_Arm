# Stepper-Servo_Based_Robotic_Arm
This repository contains a robotic arm that is either a hybrid of both Servo Motors and Stepper Motors or just Stepper Motors.

Eventual completed arm will contain either four Stepper Motors or 2 Stepper Motors and 2 Servo Motors depending on which one you go with. All parts can be 3d printed and a few of the parts can be made on a cnc for quicker creation. 

At the current stage of development, the first two stages of the robotic arm's tilt are complete.
