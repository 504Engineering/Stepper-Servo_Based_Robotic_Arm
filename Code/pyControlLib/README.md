This Library is for use with 504 Engineering Robotic Arm. 

It is used to send signals and data to a RPI pico via a serial communication link.

Libraries that are installed with it:
    pySerial

This library contains useful functions that can be used to accurately store and send data to any serial device,
as long as the com port and baud rate are set correctly.
